Hi, this is Jiuqi. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), working with [Dr. Shangtong Zhang](https://shangtongzhang.github.io/) in Sequential Decision-Making Lab.
My research interests center around understanding and developing efficient and robust algorithms to solve complex sequential decision-making problems.
Currently, I am focusing on the theory and applications of **reinforcement learning**.
I also think **deep learning** and **heuristic search** are cool.

Before joining UVA, I earned my MSc. (thesis track) in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) under the co-supervision of [Dr. Martin MÃ¼ller](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/) and [Dr. Jonathan Schaeffer](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~jonathan/).
Our [research group](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/students.html) is affiliated with [Amii](https://www.amii.ca/).
I received my BSc. in Honours Computer Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I was supervised by [Dr. Hsiu-chin Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/hsiuchinlin/) for [Science Undergraduate Research Award](https://www.mcgill.ca/science/research/undergraduate-research/sura).
