## üéº Music ##
I have a passion for music as much as AI. I play the acoustic guitar, electric guitar and drum kit. I used to play in a rock band in my high school. Oddly enough, I was the drummer even though I didn't know how to drum when we started. Nevertheless, it was an incredible period of my life. I enjoyed every minute of playing on the stage. Nowadays, I play more fingerstyles because it isn't as fun strumming chords to myself as playing them with the folks. I have been gaining interest in neo-soul guitar for the past couple of months. I might give it a try this year. I own a Yamaha FS-TA TransAcoustic guitar. The all-in-one reverb and chorus are brilliant!

My go-to music genre is still Rock and Roll, but I have also been exploring other types of music. Recently, I've been pretty into J-pop, Britpop and Mandarin rock. Below is a partial listing of bands/individuals I love to listen to by genre.

- **J-pop:** King Gnu, X Japan (RIP Heath), One Ok Rock, Yorushika, Yoasobi, Radwimps, MAISONdes, Kenshi Yonezu, Vaundy, Minami 373, ...
- **Britpop:** The Beatles, Oasis, Blur, Suede, Radiohead, The Verve, ...
- **Mandarin rock:** Cui Jian, Dou Wei, He Yong, Zhang Chu, Tang Dynasty, GALA, Omnipotent Youth Society, No Party For Cao Dong, ...
- **Progressive Rock:** Pink Floyd, Polyphia, ...
- **Electric:** Yellow Magic Orchestra, ...
- **Fingerstyle:** Masaaki Kishibe, Kotaro Oshio, Kim Youngso, Sungha Jung...


## üç≥ Cooking ##
Cooking gives me peace and satisfaction. Not only do I cook dishes from my cultural background, but I also love to learn and experiment with cuisine from other parts of the world. Below are some of the dishes I cook that are decent presentation-wise (and tasty, of course).

## üèÄ Sports ##
I play a couple of recreational sports, such as basketball and badminton. I used to play intramural basketball in my undergraduate and master's. We had a lot of fun. I wish to learn table tennis in 2024.
